# customvision-tfjs
NPM package for TensorFlow.js models exported from Custom Vision Service

## Install
```sh
npm install @microsoft/customvision-tfjs
```

Or, if you would like to use CDN,

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/customvision-tfjs"></script>
```

## Usage

```html
<img id="image" src="test_image.jpg" />
```

### Classification
```js
import * as cvstfjs from '@microsoft/customvision-tfjs';

let model = new cvstfjs.ClassificationModel();
await model.loadModelAsync('model.json');
const image = document.getElementById('image');
const result = await model.executeAsync(image);
```

The result is a 1D-array of probabilities.

### Object Detection
```js
import * as cvstfjs from '@microsoft/customvision-tfjs';

let model = new cvstfjs.ObjectDetectionModel();
await model.loadModelAsync('model.json');
const image = document.getElementById('image');
const result = await model.executeAsync(image);
```

The result has 3 arrays.
```js

[
	[[0.1, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3], [0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 0.9]], // bounding boxes (x1, y1, x2, y2)
	[0.2, 0.3], // probabilities
	[1, 4] // class ids
]
```
